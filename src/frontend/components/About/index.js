              We believe that sum of all the parts is different from the
              individual pieces. This means that as we work together, we are on
              our way to building a happier and healthier society.{" "}

              We want to change the way people think about shopping. Planning is
              a fundamental way to be prepared for whatever life throws at you.
              If you plan ahead, you can find a lot more options and deals.{" "}

              We believe individuals and small businesses are strengthened by
              coordinating with others. We value small business and the family
              unit as the foundation of society, and believe that joining with
              others helps preserve those values.

              The power of volume purchasing has generally gone to large
              companies or individuals with significant resources. We can get
              more buying power to individuals by creating groups of people and
              pooling our resources together.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also hope to join with you in having a lot of fun along the
              way. Yepple group orders can help with taking care of daily needs,
              finishing do-it-yourself projects, gathering with friends who
              share hobbies, or preparing for emergencies.
